Added configuration file make_KtJets_HB_HO.txt for Kt algorithm and modified configuration file make_CaloTowers_HB_HO.txt to include thresholds on individual EE and EB rechits for inclusion in the CaloTower.

** V00-00-03  [Mon Jan  9 17:39:28 2006]
modified make_CaloTowers_HB_HO.txt to fix crash and use noise thresholds from Physics TDR volume I.  As of CMSSW_0_3_0 the job that creates CaloTowers.root needs to be built with V01-04-00 of CalibCalorimetry/HcalPlugins to run without crashing. Checked in corresponding CaloTowers.root file and xml file

** V00-00-02  [Wed Nov 23 03:43:41 2005]
Bring CaloTowers creation config file up to date with external changes

** V00-00-01  [Fri Oct 28 03:33:13 2005]
Streamline configuration file and remove obsolete files.
